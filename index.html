    <h1>Heading One</h1>
    <!-- HTML is a syntactical laguage which basically makes up the struture of you language
        - Every tag has it's own meaning....For example:- The meaning behind h1 tag and h2 tag is not like H1 gives a slightly larger heading than h2 rather 
        it signifies that h1 tag has greater importance then comes h2 tag which has lesser importance.
        - More example is that you can write address in a paragraph in your footer tag too but rather you should write addres in <address> tag.
        - Case Sensitive
        -Doctype tells Browser that this document is of type HTML
        - title tag and favicon tag- this tag is used to display a small title of the site on title
        
        - A tag along with all it's data is an element For eg;- <h1>title</h1> This entire is an element
         - if you don't want to put any value inside an attribute then simply write a # which indicates that i'll will write this value later
         - title attribute in every title gives you the title when hover over the text or whatever is provided in betweeen the tags
